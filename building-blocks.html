title: 'Building Blocks'
---
<p>These are some of the common building blocks I have pullled from my research into this layer of the API space.</p>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Identification</strong> - Links establish connections across resources, and thus need ways to identify the linked resources. </li>
<li><strong>Link Relation Type</strong> - Link relations are one way of typing links, allowing them to be annotated with information about why a client might want to follow a given link.</li>
<li><strong>Human-Readable Label(s)</strong> - If a link is used in human-facing applications, then it often can be helpful to include human-readable labels. </li>
<li><strong>Target Resource Hints</strong> - A link itself should represent all the information that a client needs to decide whether it should or should not traverse the link, based on client goals. </li>
<li><strong>Traversal Hints</strong> - A link communicates to a client one possible hypermedia navigation, and the client might choose to follow a link based on client goals. </li>
<li><strong>Topology</strong> - While links usually are thought of to have two participating resources or subresources (the source and the target), link models can also support other topologies. </li>
<li><strong>Directionality</strong> - Directionality is the question of how a link is directed when it is not symmetric. </li>
<li><strong>Resource Role</strong> - In simple link structures, the roles of resources are implicit in the definition and the direction of the link. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hypermedia Formats</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection+JSON</strong> - Collection+JSON is a JSON-based read/write hypermedia-type designed to support management and querying of simple collections.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</strong> - Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879)</li>
<li><strong>Home Documents</strong> - A home document format for non-browser HTTP  clients.</li>
<li><strong>Hydra</strong> - Hydra is an effort to simplify the development of interoperable, hypermedia-driven Web APIs. </li>
<li><strong>Hypertext Application Language (HAL)</strong> - HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.</li>
<li><strong>JSON API</strong> - A specification for building APIs in JSON, and consistently formatting their responses.</li>
<li><strong>Mason</strong> - Mason is a JSON format for introducing hypermedia elements to classic JSON data representations. </li>
<li><strong>Noun As Resource With HyperLinks (NARWHL)</strong> - A framework intended to provide a roadmap for those needing to implement an API using current best practices, but is flexible enough to grow into the future.</li>
<li><strong>Siren</strong> - A hypermedia specification for representing entities in APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Uniform Basis for Exchanging Representations (UBER)</strong> - The UBER message format is a minimal read/write hypermedia type designed to support simple state transfers and ad-hoc hypermedia-based transitions. </li>
<li><strong>XForms</strong> - XForms is an XML format used for collecting inputs from web forms, and can be used to describe a user interface and a set of common data manipulation tasks.</li>
<li><strong>XML Inclusions (XInclude)</strong> - Inclusion is a format to merge a number of XML information sets into a single composite infoset. </li>
<li><strong>XML Linking Language (XLink)</strong> - Allows elements to be inserted into XML documents in order to create and describe links between resources.</li>
<li><strong>xml:id</strong> - An ID attribute in XML documents and defines processing of this attribute to identify IDs in the absence of validation, without fetching external resources, and without relying on an internal subset.</li>
</ul>
