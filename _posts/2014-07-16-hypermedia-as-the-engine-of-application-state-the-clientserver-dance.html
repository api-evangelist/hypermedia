<p>We are currently seeing a significant amount of discussion about building hypermedia APIs.  However, the server side only plays part of the role in a hypermedia driven system.  To take full advantage of the benefits of hypermedia, the client must allow the server to take the lead and drive the state of the client.  As I like to say, it takes two to Tango.So you think you can dance?</p>
