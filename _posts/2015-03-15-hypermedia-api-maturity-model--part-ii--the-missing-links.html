<p>Hypermedia is not only a conceptual and philosophical subject of interesting and animate debates among the API community, it’s also a concrete solution we can use to cover concrete needs.In this second part of hypermedia API maturity model (HAMM) series I will talk about my own experience to expose two missing (in my humble opinon) notions in common implementations and include these missing links in an updated version of the HAMM.If you have not read part I you can read it here.Crossing the hypermedia path
Hypermedia in general and the concepts described in this post in particular are not only concepts but also concrete solutions to needs that I had to deal with on a project.This project consisted in designing and building an API offering the same functionalities as my company’s web site as a prelude of a complete rewriting of this web site.</p>
