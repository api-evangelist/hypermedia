<p>In my previous post I said that REST is a protocol design technique.Chances are you do not agree or at least not completely.REST can be deceptively simple and frustratingly controversial at the same time.We often find ourselves in the middle of heated debates and are quickly labeled dogmatic RESTafarians or clueless, reckless hackers when expressing an opinion.If you don’t know what I’m talking about, read this well-researched article by Ivan Zuzak or better yet, join a REST discussion group.</p>
