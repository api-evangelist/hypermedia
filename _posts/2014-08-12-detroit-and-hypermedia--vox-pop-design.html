<p>I recently had the pleasure of attending the 2014 API Craft Conference.Despite the compelling nature of the content, the host city, Detroit, could not be ignored.I came for the ideas and left haunted by the venue.What happens when a city struggles to wear the infrastructure built for a population twice the current size?Its not a particular building, or block, or area; the entire downtown is a hodgepodge of modern, inhabited buildings standing alongside achingly beautiful, yet derelict, ruins.</p>
