<p>Hypermedia APIs are systems which want a consuming API (the programmed client) to do that as well.Hypermedia APIs accomplish this by responding to requests with both the requested data AND other resources available or actions to take.Example: Pagination
  An API for a blog might return a list of the 10 most recent articles.The same response for a Hypermedia API may return both the 10 most recent articles, and links for Next Page and Last Page.This allows your API client to learn those links programmatically, and never have to assume those links via hard-coding of URLs or parameters.</p>
