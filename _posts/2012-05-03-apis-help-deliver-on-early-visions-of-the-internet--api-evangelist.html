<p>As my professional career moved online during the years between 1995 and 2000, I had numerous visions about what the World Wide Web could do for businesses.I think I shared these visions with millions of other individuals, fueling what we now know as the first Internet bubble.I saw e-commerce driving entirely new businesses that could operate entirely online, and strengthen existing brick and mortar businesses allowing anyone to buy and sell goods and services from anywhere, instantly.What we ended up with was still important, but the web 1.0 world was not quite as grand as I think some of us had envisioned.</p>
