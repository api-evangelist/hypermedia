<p>should be suitable for use in high latency environments which permit partial failures, have no shared state and no reliable synchronization mechanism
 
I also argued that technology alone – no matter which technology you choose – only helps you with the first requirement.The concepts, principles, and methods of protocol design can help you meet the second condition.I’d understand if you were a bit surprised.Protocol design is indeed applicable because API and protocol are two alternative – but equally correct – ways of describing software interfaces.Wikipedia defines API as “… a particular set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other” and protocol as “… a formal description of digital message formats and the rules for exchanging those messages in or between computing systems and in telecommunications.</p>
