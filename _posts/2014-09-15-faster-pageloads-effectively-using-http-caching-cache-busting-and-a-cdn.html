<p>Faster Pageloads: Effectively using HTTP Caching, Cache Busting, and a CDN
It seems HTTP caching is one of those things few devs ever really need to think about.We expect webservers to cache assets intelligently, and largely ignore caching except when testing, when were sure to use the tricks weve used for years: hard refreshing, dev tools cache clearing, maybe an extension to simplify those.But ultimately, thats about the extent of it.Caching works great!Or rather, it works well enough, and we have more important things to do.</p>
