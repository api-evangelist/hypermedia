<p>It was so full of bollox that I almost started to hyperventilate – which is a pun on the abundant use of the word hypermedia in that same post Let me just quote one part of the post: This subtle shift in the source of application control information makes it possible for the same client code to recognize and execute new features as they appear over time without the need for patches or downloads The post contains more nonsense like this.Let me quote yet another brilliant piece, and be done with quoting: Similar to the problem faced by system architects, developers lack the tooling for implementing hypermedia systems Allegedly, what this author calls hypermedia systems hasn’t been conquering every single IT system in the world because of missing tooling?Permission to laugh or cry please… The piece praises the browser as a limited version of this ingenious contraption which enables the user to perform diverse tasks like banking and gaming with just the same browser without the need to download.Well excuse me, but all your browser does is continuously download – all the time But let’s leave the post for what it is, and address the issue at hand: changing functionality and function calls within a global IT system (which I think we can call the web, and many Enterprise applications – not to mention the average SaaS).The basic problem is the evolutionary change aspect.</p>
