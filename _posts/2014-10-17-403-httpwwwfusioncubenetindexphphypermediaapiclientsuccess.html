<p>Mike Admundsen visited the Lonely Planet offices recently and spent all day discussing the current state of API development, and thoughts on what the future holds – for those brave enough to take the risk.One thing that I walked away from the day-long event with was the thought, “Ok, so we’ve mostly been doing this for a decade and we’ve kinda painted ourselves into a corner, but there’s a few people who are trying to do it the right way.Why can’t we, today, start churning out hypermedia APIs and clients that can easily consume them?”
Well, the answer is: It’s hard.The solution is to make it easier.</p>
