<p>Gustaf Kotte from Jayway software innovation consultancy describes HTML as the lowest common denominator in a world where the number of devices is steadily growing.Yet we act as if it is the opposite, with mobile clients putting on weight while application programming interfaces (APIs) are trimmed down.In reality, APIs and HTML can be united in a smart way for a fantastic outcome.Hypermedia APIs can do just that.With a hypermedia API, you donâ€™t just build a regular CRUD JSON API, but you include links and controls for working with resources.</p>
