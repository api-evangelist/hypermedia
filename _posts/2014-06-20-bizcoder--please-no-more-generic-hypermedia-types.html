<p>This opinion has been stewing for a couple of years now, but following an excellent conversation I had with Ted Young the other evening at the API Craft San Francisco event, I think it is time to have more discussion around this subject.A little bit of history 
I have been a big supporter of the HAL media type ever since Mike Kelly showed me his first sample on the freenode #REST IRC channel.I actively pushed for the use of HAL within several teams at Microsoft and a number of other large corporations.I saw HAL as an opportunity to introduce people to hypermedia using a simple, flexible, standardized format.Â  HAL has its flaws, but it served my purpose.</p>
