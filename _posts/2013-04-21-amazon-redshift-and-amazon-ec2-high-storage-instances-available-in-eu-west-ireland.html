<p>Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that makes it simple and cost-effective to efficiently analyze all your data using your existing business intelligence tools.The service is optimized for analyzing data sets of several hundred gigabytes to a petabyte or more and can provide significantly better performance for less than one tenth the price of most data warehousing solutions available to you today.Amazon Redshift also frees you from all the muck associated with provisioning, monitoring, backing up, patching, securing, and scaling your data warehouse.High Storage Instances (hs1.8xlarge) are an Amazon EC2 instance type that is ideal for customers whose applications require high sequential read and write performance over very large data sets.</p>
