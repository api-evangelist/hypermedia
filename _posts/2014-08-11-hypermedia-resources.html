<p>Hypermedia Resources   Aug 8, 2014   
Over the past few months, there has been a noticeable increase in interest in hypermedia APIs.To date, the discussion reached peak intensity during API Craft 2014 in Detroit a couple of weeks ago.Since then, the conversation has kept going on Twitter and on blogs and you know, wherever API folk gather.I thought it might be useful to put together a list of hypermedia resources that people can use to familiarize themselves with the topic.This list will get much longer as I will continue to add to it as I remember good resources and more appear.</p>
