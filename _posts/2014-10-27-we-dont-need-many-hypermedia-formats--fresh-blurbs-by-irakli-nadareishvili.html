<p>Views expressed on this blog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.In addition, commenters are responsible for their comments.Earlier today, I had a very interesting Twitter exchange with Darrel Miller.That exchange inspired me to share some of my thoughts about media types, in the context of Hypermedia Architecture and APIs.Before we ask that question, what we really should be asking is: why do we even need media types?</p>
