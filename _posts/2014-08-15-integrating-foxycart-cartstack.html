<p>We are excited to tell you about our newest integration, CartStack.Merchants no longer have to be the victim of lost sales due to abandoned carts.Â CartStack allows you to super-power your FoxyCart store by monitoring when customers abandon their shopping cart and sending them real-time, conversion focused emails to persuade them to finalize their purchase.On average, CartStack helps merchants recover about 15% of their abandoned customers.Beyond their superb phone and email support, free setup, and affordable pricing plans, CartStack comes packed with everything merchants will need to quickly start recovering abandoned customers.</p>
