<p>David Heinemeier Hansson’s post about hypermedia APIs has sparked some very interesting discussion about the usefulness of hypermedia APIs, but the visceral reaction to the API was surprising.It’s pretty eye opening to realize that many developers just do not grok hypermedia APIs because they’re still thinking in terms of data - not in terms of content negotiation.First, let’s acknowledge the good parts of DHH’s post:
  Do not return ids, return uris.Don’t construct them in the client.It makes the API much easier to develop simple client libraries for, especially if you use what Steve Klabnik calls the hypermedia proxy pattern.</p>
