I’m excited to release a new way to interface to API Blueprints.A client-side framework in Swift that allows you to introspect and perform actions at run-time.Imagine an API client that can use the already-defined information from an API Blueprint to build a request rather than hardcoding that information.This allows you to start building smarter clients which can evolve at run-time based on the blueprint.</p>
