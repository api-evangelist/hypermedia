<p>I had the honor to be one of the attendees at the first annual API Craft Detroit conference last year, which was so successful that it spawned abunch of API Meetups around the globe (I regularly attend API Craft Boston, which is a roving band of API lovers who tough out the winter meetups over Google Hangout).This year, I bought my ticket as soon as I could and then groaned as life got in the way and I had to miss the first day of the conference.But I made it to the second day and got a whole new perspective by walking in after the sessions were set up and the energy was already humming.I was relieved though to see that the guidelines for this open space conference remained the same as last year (although with fancier signage).This year the conference did something new by setting aside a half day for aconcentrated discussion on Hypermedia APIs.</p>
