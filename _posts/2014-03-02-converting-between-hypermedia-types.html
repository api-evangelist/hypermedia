<p>Building a hypermedia API can be hard.Many times, we build our APIs around one specific hypermedia format, while either not supporting other formats or minimally supporting one or two.This article aims to look at an idea for building your API in one format, and then converting to other formats automatically.I’d like to first look at our current API practices, and then explore this idea of converting between hypermedia formats.I have also started a project around this idea called Hyperdescribe that I’ll look at toward the end as well.</p>
